THE EMPERICAL STUDY OF METHOD CHAINING IN JAVA

method chaining is a good practice for improving code readability , other refer to it as a bad practice that worsens code quality .In this  we first investigate whether method changing is programming style accepted by real world programmers. To answer this question we collected java repositories on GitHub and analyzed historical trends in the frequency of method chaining method. Chaining is a programming style in which multiple method invocations are chained in a single

 . setTitle  (“warning”);
 . Set message (“are you sure?”). show ();
method chaining is promoted as a good practice that improves the readability of source code .By method chaining  ,redundant temporary variables and code repetitions are eliminated related an expressions becomes easy to read from left to right as a natural language texts the controversy above leads us to our first question ;Is method chaining accepted widely real world  programmers ? To answer this questions .we collected java repositories on GitHub and an analyzed historical trends in the frequency of method chaining .If method chaining is commonly considered as a bed practice programmers would avoid chaining method invocations .As a result the frequency would be the same or decrease over time .conversely if the frequency increases that the result will be supportive evidence for the wide acceptable of method chaining in the real world.


  KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER in modern 
                 code review

Knowledge Transfer in modern code review published in 28th International Conference on program comprehension, October 5,62020 seol republic of Korea . Knowledge transfer is one of the main goals of modern code review as show by several studies the surveyed and interveiwed developers. Code review is the process in which peer developers inspect the code written by a teammate to assess its quality, to recommend changes and finally, to approve it for merging. some  authors studied the factors influencing the likelihood of getting a patch accepted as the result of the code review process, while other getting the reviewing habits of developers in specific contexts several works on the benefits motivation and expectation of the review process .Only a few researchers analyzed data from quantitative perspective ,mostly to assess the impact of code review on code quality ( e. g : the relationship between code review and post release defeats).After the code review process ,identifying various influencing factors, such as 1:Programming language 2:size and complexity of the PR 3:Addition and change of files 4:Excessive forking 5:Tests 6:Developers type 7:Experience in making PRS 8:Number of comments .The relevance of code reviews has been investigated from different perspectives .The effects of code reviews on knowledge transfer has been only marginally studied , let alone from a quantitative prespective, which is the goal of this paper . We presented a quantitative study to investigate knowledge transfer in code review. Our results were negative: we were not able to capture the positive role played by code review in knowledge transfer among developers, as was previously suggested in the literature. Therefore, our main direction for future work includes additional studies investigating the same research questions with a different experimental design. Specifically, we will investigate which measures can be used as a precise proxy to represent the knowledge transfer,in both quantitative and qualitative way.
 

A HUMAN STUDY OF COMPREHENSION AND CODE                                            SUMMARIZATION 


Software developers spend a great deal of time reading and understanding ode that is poorly documented, written by other developers , or develop using different styles .source code comments play an invaluable role in faciliating program comprehension .Resent work have been shown that developers considers comment to be the most important documentation artifacts for software maintenance tasks , other than the source code itself .well documented source code manifestly effects developers productivity both when investigating an existing large codebases .Researchers have propose numerous techniques to automatically generate summary comments for source code .These techniques traditionally rely on elaborate heuristics and templates to generate comments that resemble natural  language .However ,designing these method can essential substantial human efforts and implicit assumption about that ideal structure of comments (e. g : some java documentation system rely on a verb-noun style imposed by the developer). Automatic code summarization is becoming increasingly important for addressing the storage of well-documented code. Well documented code is known to influence comprehension for both new and experience developers .To our knowledge, no prior work has explored the impact of automatic, on extrinsic  developer  comprehension.
